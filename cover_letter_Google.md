Dear Google Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for engineering roles at Google where I can contribute to building and scaling systems that impact billions of users worldwide. As someone who has architected infrastructure serving 220,000+ users across 180+ countries and built AI-powered automation systems, I am inspired by Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

## **Why Google?**

Google represents the gold standard for engineering excellence, innovation at scale, and user-centric product development. From search algorithms that answer billions of queries daily to cloud infrastructure powering the world's largest enterprises, Google builds systems that set industry benchmarks for reliability, performance, and scalability.

I'm particularly drawn to Google's commitment to **10x thinking**—not incremental improvements, but transformative innovations that fundamentally change how people interact with technology. This philosophy resonates deeply with my own approach to engineering, where I've consistently sought to build systems that don't just solve today's problems but create entirely new possibilities.

## **Demonstrated Impact at Scale**

**Scaling SaaS Infrastructure (RevisionDojo - YC W24):**
As DevOps Engineer at one of the fastest-growing AI SaaS companies in Y Combinator's W24 batch, I architected end-to-end CRM automation infrastructure and scaled platform infrastructure to reliably serve **220,000+ International Baccalaureate students across 180+ countries**. This role demanded the same rigor, reliability, and scalability mindset that Google engineers apply daily—measuring everything, optimizing for latency, and ensuring 99.9%+ uptime for a global user base.

Key technical achievements:
- Built analytics infrastructure tracking user engagement, conversion funnels, and revenue metrics at scale
- Developed real-time monitoring and alerting systems for critical business metrics using Python and PostgreSQL
- Collaborated directly with CEO to create custom SQL queries and KPI dashboards driving data-driven decisions
- Designed scalable Go-To-Market operations framework supporting rapid B2B expansion

**Building AI-Powered Automation:**
At Wiko Cutlery Ltd, I architected and deployed an AI agent leveraging **Hunyuan T1** (Tencent's LLM) and **DeepSeek API** with WeCom integration, automating operational workflows across three manufacturing facilities in Hong Kong. This project showcased my ability to integrate cutting-edge AI/ML technologies into production systems—a skill directly applicable to Google's growing focus on AI-powered products (Gemini, Vertex AI, etc.).

Results:
- **Reduced manual coordination overhead by 35%** through intelligent workflow automation
- **Increased production capacity by 40%** by implementing GenAI-powered software
- **Reduced lead times by 25%** through process optimization and automation

**Data-Driven Optimization:**
At Linoroso Brands Ltd, I drove **$800,000 annual revenue** through data-driven omnichannel optimization. Using predictive analytics and machine learning approaches, I optimized inventory allocation across multiple fulfillment centers, improving inventory turnover by 20% while reducing carrying costs. I built custom analytics dashboards and A/B testing frameworks that achieved 15%+ improvement in ROAS—demonstrating the same experimentation-driven culture that defines Google's product development.

## **Technical Strengths Aligned with Google's Stack**

**Programming & Software Engineering:**
- **Python (Advanced):** Extensive experience building production systems, automation tools, and data pipelines
- **SQL Mastery:** MySQL, PostgreSQL—complex query optimization, database design, and analytics
- **Distributed Systems:** Experience scaling infrastructure to serve hundreds of thousands of concurrent users
- **API Development:** Built REST APIs and integrated numerous third-party services at scale

**DevOps & Site Reliability:**
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (Bedrock, EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS), infrastructure as code, scalability patterns
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Built deployment pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure automation
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Real-time monitoring systems, alerting, and performance optimization
- **Reliability Engineering:** Focus on uptime, latency optimization, and graceful degradation

**Data Engineering & Analytics:**
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, ETL pipeline development, large-scale data processing
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, predictive modeling, time series analysis, A/B testing frameworks
- **Big Data:** Apache Spark (familiar), distributed data processing concepts
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, custom dashboards with real-time data

**AI/ML Integration:**
- **GenAI APIs:** AWS Bedrock, Claude API, OpenAI API, Hunyuan T1, DeepSeek API
- **Production AI Systems:** Built and deployed AI agents in production environments
- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques for optimizing LLM outputs and building AI workflows

## **Google-Like Approach to Problem Solving**

**Measure Everything:** At RevisionDojo, I built comprehensive analytics infrastructure to track every aspect of user behavior and platform performance. This data-driven approach enabled rapid iteration and optimization—the same philosophy behind Google Analytics and Firebase.

**Think at Scale:** Architecting systems for 220,000+ users across 180+ countries taught me to think about global distribution, latency optimization, and handling diverse user contexts—challenges Google engineers face daily.

**Obsess Over User Experience:** My work at Linoroso improving inventory turnover by 20% wasn't just about algorithms—it was about ensuring customers found products in stock, received orders on time, and had seamless shopping experiences.

**10x Innovation:** As Founder & CEO of SNF Global LLC, I built a business from concept to $50,000 revenue in 9 months by applying AI automation in novel ways—using Claude Code, MCP integration, and SQL databases to create operational efficiency that traditional businesses couldn't match. This entrepreneurial mindset of finding 10x solutions aligns perfectly with Google's innovation culture.

## **Commitment to Continuous Learning**

I'm currently upskilling in areas critical to Google's engineering stack:
- **Advanced Machine Learning:** Completing Stanford's Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)
- **Big Data Engineering:** Deep dive into Apache Spark and distributed systems
- **Cloud Certifications:** Pursuing AWS Certified Solutions Architect (transferable knowledge to GCP)
- **System Design:** Studying distributed systems patterns, scalability architectures, and reliability engineering

## **Why I'm Excited About Google**

**Impact at Scale:** Google's products touch billions of lives. I want to contribute to systems where optimizing latency by milliseconds or improving algorithm accuracy by 1% translates to enormous real-world impact.

**Technical Excellence:** Google sets industry standards for engineering practices, from code review culture to testing rigor to system design. I want to grow surrounded by world-class engineers tackling humanity's most interesting technical challenges.

**Innovation Culture:** Google's 20% time, "Moonshot" projects, and commitment to research-driven product development create an environment where ambitious ideas become reality. I want to be part of teams building the future—whether that's next-generation AI, quantum computing, or technologies we haven't imagined yet.

**Diverse Problem Domains:** From search algorithms to self-driving cars to quantum computers, Google tackles an incredible breadth of technical challenges. This diversity offers unparalleled opportunities for learning and impact.
