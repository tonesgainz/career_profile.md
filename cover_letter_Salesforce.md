Dear Salesforce Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for engineering roles at Salesforce, where I can contribute to building trusted, customer-centric platforms that empower businesses to transform how they connect with customers. Having architected CRM automation infrastructure at a Y Combinator startup and built systems serving 220,000+ users globally, I am inspired by Salesforce's mission to help companies grow their relationships with customers in entirely new ways.

## **Alignment with Salesforce's Core Values**

Salesforce's values—**Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality, and Sustainability**—deeply resonate with my professional journey and personal commitments:

### **Trust: The Foundation of Everything**

At RevisionDojo (YC W24), trust wasn't optional—it was essential. As DevOps Engineer, I architected end-to-end CRM automation infrastructure serving **220,000+ International Baccalaureate students across 180+ countries**. When students and educators rely on your platform for exam preparation, downtime isn't an inconvenience—it's a breach of trust. I built real-time monitoring and alerting systems to ensure platform reliability, and developed analytics infrastructure that maintained data integrity while tracking user engagement and revenue metrics at scale.

This commitment to reliability and data security aligns perfectly with Salesforce's obsession with trust as the #1 value. I understand that customers entrust Salesforce with their most critical business data, and every line of code must reflect that responsibility.

### **Customer Success: Data-Driven Impact**

My entire career has centered on driving measurable customer success through technology:

**At Linoroso Brands Ltd (CMO):** Drove **$800,000 annual revenue** by obsessing over customer experience. I optimized inventory allocation using predictive analytics to ensure products were in stock when customers wanted them—improving inventory turnover by 20% while reducing carrying costs. I built automated omni-channel funnels integrating Meta, Google Ads, and Shopify, then used A/B testing to improve ROAS by 15%+. Every optimization was driven by understanding customer behavior through data.

**At SNF Global LLC (Founder & CEO):** Generated $50,000 revenue in 9 months by engineering AI automation that improved customer experience. Using Claude Code, MCP integration, and SQL databases, I built systems that processed orders faster, provided real-time inventory visibility, and enabled personalized customer communication at scale.

This customer-first mindset is exactly what Salesforce represents—using technology not for its own sake, but to drive tangible business outcomes for customers.

### **Innovation: Building the Future of CRM**

I'm excited by Salesforce's innovation in AI-powered CRM through Einstein AI, Agentforce, and Data Cloud. My hands-on experience with GenAI positions me to contribute immediately:

**Production AI Systems:** Architected and deployed an AI agent at Wiko Cutlery Ltd leveraging **Hunyuan T1** and **DeepSeek API** with WeCom integration, automating workflows across three manufacturing facilities. This reduced manual coordination overhead by 35% and increased production capacity by 40%.

**AWS Bedrock Integration:** Currently developing a GenAI-powered carbon compliance platform using AWS Bedrock (Amazon's managed foundation model service) with PostgreSQL backend. This project, backed by AWS Premier Partner support, demonstrates my ability to architect enterprise-grade AI solutions.

**Multi-Model AI Experience:** Hands-on experience with Claude API, OpenAI API, Hunyuan T1, DeepSeek API, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. I understand the nuances of different LLMs and how to architect systems that leverage their strengths.

This aligns perfectly with Salesforce's vision of bringing trusted AI into every CRM workflow through Einstein and Agentforce.

### **Equality: Inclusive Leadership**

As **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Chair** for Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity at UCSB, I led DEI initiatives and cultural competency programs to foster an inclusive community culture. I understand that diverse teams build better products and that representation matters in tech.

Additionally, as a fluent Mandarin and Cantonese speaker who has worked across US, Hong Kong, and EU markets, I bring a global perspective and cultural fluency that enables me to build products for diverse, international user bases—essential for Salesforce's global customer base.

### **Sustainability: Environmental Commitment**

My commitment to sustainability is both academic and professional:
- **Academic Focus:** Pursuing B.A. in Environmental Studies at UCSB with coursework in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), ESG Analysis, and Environmental Framework Analysis
- **Professional Application:** Developing a GenAI-powered carbon compliance platform to help businesses measure, monitor, and reduce their environmental impact
- **Data-Driven Sustainability:** Applied data science methodologies to environmental impact analysis and sustainability metrics

This aligns with Salesforce's commitment to being a net-zero company and helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals through platforms like Net Zero Cloud.

## **Technical Expertise for Salesforce Engineering**

**CRM & Sales Automation:**

## **Why Salesforce?**

**Customer-Centric Mission:** Salesforce's mission to help companies connect with customers in entirely new ways resonates with my passion for using technology to drive real business impact. I want to build platforms that don't just automate processes but fundamentally transform how businesses build relationships.

**Innovation at Scale:** Salesforce serves 150,000+ customers globally, from small businesses to Fortune 500 enterprises. The scale and diversity of use cases present incredible engineering challenges—from multi-tenancy and data isolation to global distribution and regulatory compliance.

**AI-Powered Future:** Salesforce is leading the enterprise AI revolution with Einstein, Agentforce, and Data Cloud. I'm excited to contribute to building trusted, business-ready AI that delivers measurable value—not just impressive demos.

**Values-Driven Culture:** Salesforce's commitment to trust, equality, and sustainability aligns with my personal values. I want to work for a company that measures success not just by revenue but by positive impact on customers, employees, communities, and the planet.

**San Francisco Ecosystem:** As someone planning to relocate to San Francisco in Q2 2026, I'm excited about joining Salesforce's vibrant Salesforce Tower community and contributing to the city's thriving tech ecosystem.
