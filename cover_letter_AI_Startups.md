Dear [Startup] Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in engineering roles at [Startup] where I can contribute to building transformative AI products from the ground up. As someone who has lived the startup journey—both as DevOps Engineer at RevisionDojo (YC W24, one of the fastest-growing AI SaaS companies in the W24 batch) and as Founder & CEO of my own venture—I understand what it takes to build and scale in the zero-to-one phase.

## **Why I Thrive in Startup Environments**

**I've Lived Both Sides of the Startup Journey:**

**As Early Employee (RevisionDojo - YC W24):**
Joined as DevOps Engineer during critical hypergrowth phase and contributed to scaling platform infrastructure serving **220,000+ International Baccalaureate students across 180+ countries**. This wasn't just writing code—it was architecting end-to-end CRM automation, collaborating directly with the CEO on strategy, building analytics infrastructure that drove key decisions, and moving fast enough to keep pace with explosive user growth.

**As Founder (SNF Global LLC):**
Founded and scaled a vertically integrated manufacturing and e-commerce business from concept to **$50,000 revenue in first 9 months**. I didn't have the luxury of specializing—I was product manager, engineer, operations lead, and customer support all at once. I engineered AI automation using Claude Code, MCP integration, and SQL databases that increased operational efficiency 30%. I secured AWS Premier Partner backing and am currently building a GenAI-powered carbon compliance platform on AWS Bedrock.

This dual perspective—understanding both the technical challenges of scaling infrastructure AND the business imperatives driving product decisions—makes me especially effective in early-stage environments.

## **Technical Versatility: The Startup Superpower**

Startups need engineers who can wear multiple hats, ship fast, and adapt as priorities shift. Here's what I bring:

### **Production AI/ML Systems**

**Hands-On GenAI Experience:**
- Architected and deployed AI agent at Wiko Cutlery using **Hunyuan T1** and **DeepSeek API** with WeCom integration
- Currently building GenAI carbon compliance platform on **AWS Bedrock** with PostgreSQL backend
- Production experience with **Claude API, OpenAI API, Hunyuan T1, DeepSeek API, MCP integration**
- Advanced prompt engineering, model evaluation, and building reliable systems on probabilistic AI outputs

**Machine Learning & Data Science:**
- **Predictive Analytics:** Built sales forecasting, inventory optimization, and customer behavior models
- **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy:** Production ML pipelines and data processing at scale
- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:** Implemented frameworks achieving 15%+ improvement in ROAS
- **Time Series Analysis:** Forecasting models for sales, demand planning, and resource allocation

### **Full-Stack Engineering**

**Backend:**
- **Python (Advanced):** Production systems, APIs, automation, data pipelines, ML integration
- **Node.js:** Backend services, REST APIs, real-time systems
- **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL—complex queries, database design, optimization, analytics
- **API Development:** Built and integrated dozens of third-party APIs (Meta, Google, Shopify, Amazon, Slack, etc.)

**Frontend:**
- **React.js:** Built Shopify integrations, custom dashboards, and web applications
- **JavaScript:** Modern ES6+, async patterns, state management
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first, user-centric interfaces

### **Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps**

**AWS Expertise:**
- **Services:** Bedrock, EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS—architected scalable, cost-effective infrastructure
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Automated provisioning and configuration management
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated testing, deployment, and continuous delivery
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Real-time monitoring, alerting, performance optimization

- **Real-Time Analytics:** Built KPI dashboards and monitoring for business metrics
- **Data Warehousing:** Designed schemas for analytics, reporting, and ML training data
- **Big Data:** Apache Spark (familiar), distributed processing concepts

## **Demonstrated Impact: Moving Metrics That Matter**

Startups live and die by metrics. Here's the impact I've driven:

**Revenue Generation:**
- **$800,000 annual revenue** at Linoroso through omnichannel optimization (Amazon, Walmart, Wayfair)
- **$50,000 revenue in 9 months** as founder of SNF Global
- **Total:** $850,000+ revenue generated through data-driven optimization and automation

- Engineered workflow automation increasing operational efficiency 30%
- Built intelligent systems that learn and improve over time

## **The Startup Mindset: How I Operate**

**Ship Fast, Iterate Faster:**
I understand the startup imperative to move quickly. At RevisionDojo (YC W24), we didn't have time for perfect—we needed shipped. I built systems that could evolve as we learned what users needed, refactored as we scaled, and always prioritized delivering value over architectural perfection.

**Wear Multiple Hats:**
As a founder, I was engineer, product manager, operations lead, customer support, and marketer. I can jump between writing code, analyzing data, talking to customers, and planning strategy—whatever the business needs at that moment.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:**
Every assumption should be validated with data. I built analytics infrastructure at RevisionDojo that enabled the CEO to make data-driven decisions about product, growth, and partnerships. At Linoroso, I used A/B testing and cohort analysis to optimize every step of the customer journey.

**Customer Obsession:**
Features don't matter if users don't want them. I've built products by talking to customers, understanding their pain points, and iterating based on feedback. The goal isn't to build cool technology—it's to solve real problems.

**Resourcefulness:**
Startups have constraints—limited budget, small team, tight timelines. I thrive in this environment. At SNF Global, I used free/low-cost tools creatively, leveraged AWS credits strategically, and built automation to multiply my productivity.

**Ownership Mentality:**
I don't wait for assignments—I identify problems and solve them. As early employee at RevisionDojo, I proactively built monitoring systems, optimized queries, and improved infrastructure because I treated the platform's success as my own.

## **Why AI Startups? Why Now?**

We're living through the most transformative technological shift since the internet—the GenAI revolution. LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama are unlocking entirely new categories of products and fundamentally changing how software is built.

I'm excited about AI startups because they're at the frontier of this transformation:

**Building the Future:** AI startups aren't just improving existing products incrementally—they're creating entirely new paradigms for how humans interact with computers, access knowledge, and augment their capabilities.

**Technical Innovation:** The engineering challenges are fascinating—from prompt engineering and model fine-tuning to building reliable systems on probabilistic outputs to optimizing costs and latency at scale.

**Rapid Iteration:** The GenAI landscape evolves weekly. New models, new capabilities, new best practices. Startups can move faster than incumbents and capitalize on these shifts.

**Outsized Impact:** Early employees at AI startups have the opportunity to shape product direction, define technical architecture, and build the foundation for companies that could reach billions of users.

## **Let's Build Something Amazing**

The best part of working at startups is the opportunity to build products that didn't exist before, solve problems that haven't been solved, and create value that compounds over time. I'm looking for a team that's technically ambitious, mission-driven, and moving fast to capitalize on the GenAI opportunity.

If you're building transformative AI products and need an engineer who can ship features, scale infrastructure, analyze data, talk to customers, and do whatever it takes to win—let's talk.

I'd love to learn more about what you're building and discuss how I can contribute to your mission.

Looking forward to building the future together.

Sincerely,

Tony V. Nguyen
