## 7. 30-Day Content Calendar

### **Week 1: Technical Credibility**

**Day 1 (Monday):**
```
📊 Scaled our platform from 10K to 220K+ users in 6 months at @RevisionDojo (YC W24). Here's what we learned about infrastructure scalability:

1️⃣ Database optimization is EVERYTHING
- Moved from N+1 queries to batch loading → 10x faster
- Added strategic indexes → 5x query speedup
- Implemented connection pooling → eliminated timeout errors

2️⃣ Caching strategies saved us
- Redis for session management
- CDN for static assets
- Database query caching for dashboards

3️⃣ Monitoring prevented disasters
- Real-time alerting caught issues before users did
- Custom dashboards showed exactly where bottlenecks were
- Automated scaling rules kept costs manageable

The hardest part? Balancing speed of shipping with technical debt. In a YC startup, you're moving FAST—but cutting corners on infrastructure always catches up to you.

What's the biggest scaling challenge you've faced?

**Day 3 (Wednesday):**
```
🤖 Deployed my first production AI agent using Hunyuan T1 at Wiko Cutlery. Results?

✅ 35% reduction in manual coordination
✅ 40% increase in production capacity
✅ Real-time workflow automation across 3 facilities

Key learnings about putting LLMs in production:

1. Prompt engineering IS software engineering
   - Version control your prompts
   - Test edge cases rigorously
   - Monitor outputs like you monitor code

2. Error handling is critical
   - LLMs can hallucinate—validate outputs
   - Have fallback logic for API failures
   - Set timeouts and retries

3. Cost optimization matters
   - Cache common queries
   - Use smaller models when possible
   - Batch requests where you can

The future of manufacturing isn't just automation—it's INTELLIGENT automation.

💡 "Why should I hire you over someone with 5 years of experience?"

Got this question in a recent conversation. Here's how I answered:

"Because I've compressed 5 years of learning into 18 months.

As a founder, I didn't have the luxury of specializing. I was:
→ DevOps engineer (built infrastructure from scratch)
→ Data engineer (designed ETL pipelines and dashboards)
→ Full-stack developer (shipped features end-to-end)
→ Product manager (talked to customers, prioritized features)

Then I joined RevisionDojo (YC W24) and applied everything I learned at startup scale—220K+ users, 180+ countries, hypergrowth pace.

I bring:
✓ Ownership mentality (treat your code like it's my own company)
✓ Resourcefulness (made $50K with $0 funding)
✓ Velocity (YC teaches you to ship FAST)
✓ Full-stack thinking (understand business + tech)"

For new grads competing with experienced engineers: your superpower is HUNGER. You learn faster, work harder, and bring fresh perspectives.

Use it.

### **Week 2: Sharing Knowledge**

**Day 8 (Monday):**
```
🔧 5 Python libraries every data engineer should know (beyond pandas):

1️⃣ GREAT EXPECTATIONS - Data quality testing
   Why: Catch bad data before it breaks your pipeline
   Use case: Validate schema, check for nulls, detect anomalies

2️⃣ PREFECT - Workflow orchestration
   Why: Airflow is great, but Prefect is BETTER for modern data stacks
   Use case: Schedule jobs, handle retries, monitor pipelines

3️⃣ POLARS - Fast DataFrame library
   Why: 10-100x faster than pandas for large datasets
   Use case: Processing millions of rows locally

4️⃣ SQLALCHEMY - SQL toolkit
   Why: Write database code that works across PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
   Use case: ORM for applications, connection management

5️⃣ PYDANTIC - Data validation
   Why: Type safety + automatic validation = fewer bugs
   Use case: API request/response models, config management

Weekend project: Built a sales forecasting platform using Prophet, LSTM, and FastAPI 📈

Results:
✓ 8.1% MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
✓ Sub-second inference time
✓ Production-ready REST API

Tech stack:
- Facebook Prophet for seasonality detection
- LSTM neural networks for complex patterns
- FastAPI for the backend
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Docker for deployment

The most interesting part? Model ensembling—combining ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM predictions actually BEAT any single model.

### **Week 3: Industry Engagement**

**Day 15 (Monday):**
```
Hot take: Most "AI engineers" are just API wrapper engineers.

And that's completely FINE.

Here's why:

1️⃣ You don't need to train your own LLM
   - Use Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Gemini
   - Focus on solving user problems
   - Leave foundation model training to OpenAI/Anthropic

2️⃣ The value is in the APPLICATION
   - Prompt engineering
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Evaluation frameworks
   - Production reliability

3️⃣ Even big tech uses "wrappers"
   - ChatGPT is a wrapper around GPT-4
   - GitHub Copilot wraps OpenAI Codex
   - Most B2B AI tools use existing models

The skill isn't building the model.

The skill is:
→ Understanding WHEN to use AI
→ Designing prompts that work
→ Handling edge cases
→ Making it FAST and RELIABLE

Don't feel bad about using APIs. Feel bad if you're not solving real problems.

🎯 Rejected from 47 companies before joining RevisionDojo (YC W24).

Here's what I learned about job searching:

1. Volume matters, but quality matters MORE
   ❌ Spray and pray with generic applications
   ✅ 10 highly customized applications to dream companies

2. Your resume is a marketing document
   ❌ "Responsible for building features"
   ✅ "Scaled infrastructure serving 220K+ users"

3. Projects > Degree (especially in tech)
   ❌ Listing coursework
   ✅ Showing deployed projects with real users

4. Networking is NOT optional
   ❌ Only applying through job boards
   ✅ DMing employees, getting referrals, attending events

5. Learn from every rejection
   ❌ "They don't know what they're missing"
   ✅ "What skill gap did this reveal?"

The breakthrough? Building public projects, writing about them, and having a founder see my work and reach out.

Your GitHub is your resume. Your LinkedIn posts are your cover letter. Your side projects are your proof of skill.

### **Week 4: Thought Leadership**

**Day 22 (Monday):**
```
The future of DevOps is AI-powered. Here's what I'm seeing:

🤖 AI-Driven Monitoring
- Anomaly detection with ML models
- Predictive alerting before failures happen
- Auto-remediation of common issues

📊 Intelligent Resource Optimization
- ML models predicting traffic patterns
- Automated scaling decisions
- Cost optimization through usage forecasting

💬 Natural Language Infrastructure
- "Deploy the latest version to staging"
- "Show me error rates for the last hour"
- ChatOps powered by LLMs

🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- AI analyzing logs across distributed systems
- Automatically correlating errors
- Suggesting fixes based on historical data

We're moving from "Infrastructure as Code" to "Infrastructure as Conversation."

The DevOps engineers who level up their AI/ML skills now will be the most valuable in 3-5 years.

Lessons from 6 months at a YC startup:

1️⃣ Move fast, but measure everything
   - Ship features daily
   - But track metrics religiously
   - Data tells you what's working

2️⃣ Technical debt is a feature, not a bug
   - Perfect code = slow code
   - Ship MVP, refactor later
   - Know WHEN to pay down debt

3️⃣ Talk to users constantly
   - Build features users want, not what you think is cool
   - Quick user interviews > long planning meetings
   - Be wrong quickly, learn fast

4️⃣ Ownership > specialization
   - Everyone does everything
   - No "not my job" mentality
   - Full-stack engineers >> specialists

5️⃣ Culture is everything at small scale
   - Every hire changes the company
   - Values aren't posters on walls
   - How you work matters more than what you build

Biggest surprise? How FAST you can move when bureaucracy doesn't slow you down.

Would I trade it for big tech stability? Not yet. The learning rate is 10x.
