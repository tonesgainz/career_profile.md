**Re: Production Engineer / Data Engineer / AI/ML Engineer Position**

Dear Meta Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for engineering roles at Meta where I can contribute to building technologies that bring billions of people closer together. As someone who has scaled platforms serving 220,000+ users across 180+ countries and built AI-powered systems that drive measurable impact, I am inspired by Meta's mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.

## **Why Meta?**

Meta operates at a scale that few companies can match—nearly 4 billion people use Meta's family of apps every month. From Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp and the Quest VR ecosystem, Meta builds infrastructure and products that fundamentally shape how humanity communicates, creates, and connects.

I'm particularly drawn to three aspects of Meta's engineering culture:

**Move Fast:** At RevisionDojo (YC W24), one of the fastest-growing AI SaaS companies in the Y Combinator W24 batch, I thrived in an environment that demanded rapid execution. I architected end-to-end CRM automation infrastructure and scaled platform infrastructure to serve 220,000+ students across 180+ countries during a critical hyper-growth phase. This experience taught me that speed isn't about cutting corners—it's about making smart tradeoffs, iterating rapidly, and shipping value to users continuously.

**Focus on Impact:** Every project I've undertaken has been driven by measurable impact. At Linoroso Brands Ltd, I drove **$800,000 annual revenue** through data-driven optimization. At Wiko Cutlery Ltd, I increased production capacity by 40% and reduced lead times by 25% through AI-powered automation. I don't build technology for its own sake—I build it to move metrics that matter for users and businesses.

**Build Awesome Things:** Meta is building the future of social connection, augmented reality, virtual reality, and the metaverse. These aren't incremental improvements—they're moonshot bets that could define the next era of human interaction. I want to contribute to projects that are technically ambitious, creatively inspiring, and potentially world-changing.

## **Technical Excellence at Scale**

**Scaling Production Systems:**
At RevisionDojo, I architected infrastructure serving **220,000+ International Baccalaureate students across 180+ countries**—a fraction of Meta's scale, but enough to understand the challenges of global distribution, latency optimization, monitoring at scale, and ensuring reliability for diverse user populations across different network conditions and device capabilities.

Key achievements:
- Built analytics infrastructure tracking user engagement, conversion funnels, and revenue metrics in real-time
- Developed monitoring and alerting systems for critical business metrics using Python and PostgreSQL
- Collaborated directly with CEO to create custom SQL queries and KPI dashboards for data-driven decisions
- Designed scalable Go-To-Market operations framework supporting rapid B2B enterprise expansion

**AI/ML in Production:**
Meta's investments in AI—from content recommendation algorithms to Llama 3 to AI-powered creator tools—align perfectly with my hands-on AI/ML experience:

**Deployed Production AI Agent:** At Wiko Cutlery Ltd, I architected and deployed an AI agent leveraging **Hunyuan T1** (Tencent's LLM) and **DeepSeek API** with WeCom integration, automating operational workflows across three manufacturing facilities. This reduced manual coordination overhead by 35% and increased production capacity by 40%.

**GenAI Platform Development:** Currently building a GenAI-powered carbon compliance platform using **AWS Bedrock** with PostgreSQL backend, backed by AWS Premier Partner support. This project demonstrates my ability to architect enterprise-grade AI solutions that integrate foundation models with traditional software systems.

**Multi-Model Experience:** Hands-on experience with Claude API, OpenAI API, Hunyuan T1, DeepSeek API, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. I understand how to evaluate models, optimize prompts, handle latency/cost tradeoffs, and build reliable systems on top of probabilistic AI outputs.

**Data-Driven Optimization:**
Meta's culture of experimentation and A/B testing resonates with my approach to product development. At Linoroso, I implemented A/B testing frameworks for marketing campaigns that achieved **15%+ improvement in ROAS**. I built custom analytics dashboards for real-time campaign performance monitoring and used predictive modeling to optimize inventory allocation across fulfillment centers, improving turnover by 20%.

I understand that at Meta's scale, a 1% improvement in engagement or 10ms reduction in latency translates to enormous user impact—this is the type of optimization work that excites me.
