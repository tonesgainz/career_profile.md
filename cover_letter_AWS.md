**Re: DevOps Engineer / Cloud Infrastructure Engineer Position**

Dear AWS Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the DevOps Engineer position at Amazon Web Services. As someone who has personally experienced the transformative power of AWS infrastructure—from securing AWS Premier Partner backing for my GenAI startup to architecting scalable systems serving 220,000+ users—I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the team that builds the cloud platform powering innovation worldwide.

## **Why AWS Resonates with My Leadership Principles**

Your leadership principles align perfectly with my approach to engineering and business:

**Invent and Simplify:** As Founder & CEO of SNF Global LLC, I demonstrated this principle by building a vertically integrated manufacturing and e-commerce business that generated $50,000 revenue in nine months through innovative AI automation using Claude Code and MCP integration. I simplified complex operational workflows by engineering intelligent systems that eliminated manual processes, increasing efficiency by 30%.

**Bias for Action:** At RevisionDojo (YC W24), one of the fastest-growing AI SaaS companies in the Y Combinator W24 batch, I thrived in a hyper-growth environment that demanded rapid execution. I architected end-to-end CRM automation infrastructure and scaled platform infrastructure to reliably serve 220,000+ International Baccalaureate students across 180+ countries—all while collaborating directly with the CEO to build custom SQL queries and KPI dashboards that fueled data-driven decision-making.

**Think Big:** Leading operational transformation across three manufacturing facilities for Wiko Cutlery Ltd, I increased production capacity by 40% by implementing GenAI-powered software. I architected and deployed an AI agent leveraging Hunyuan T1 and DeepSeek API with WeCom integration, automating workflows and reducing manual coordination overhead by 35%.

**Customer Obsession:** At Linoroso Brands Ltd, I drove $800,000 in annual revenue through omnichannel marketplace operations. Every decision was driven by understanding customer behavior through data—I built automated funnels integrating Meta, Google Ads, and Shopify, then optimized inventory allocation using predictive analytics to improve turnover by 20% while reducing carrying costs.

## **Technical Excellence Aligned with AWS Technologies**

My hands-on experience with AWS services positions me to contribute immediately:

**AWS Bedrock:** Currently developing a GenAI-powered carbon compliance platform leveraging AWS Bedrock (Amazon's managed foundation model service) with PostgreSQL backend. This project, supported by AWS Premier Partner backing, demonstrates my ability to architect solutions using cutting-edge AWS GenAI services.

**Cloud Infrastructure:** Extensive experience with AWS core services including EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS. I've designed scalable, cost-effective cloud architectures that balance performance, security, and operational efficiency.

**DevOps & Automation:** Built CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and monitoring systems using Python, Git, and cloud-native tools. At RevisionDojo, I developed real-time monitoring and alerting systems for critical business metrics that ensured platform reliability at scale.

**Data Engineering:** Strong foundation in SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), Python data processing (Pandas, NumPy), and analytics infrastructure. I've built ETL pipelines, data warehouses, and real-time analytics systems that power business intelligence at scale.

## **Proven Track Record of Impact**

- **Scalability:** Scaled SaaS platform infrastructure serving 220,000+ users across 180+ countries
- **Revenue Generation:** Generated $850,000+ combined revenue across ventures through data-driven optimization
- **Operational Excellence:** Increased production capacity 40%, reduced lead times 25%, improved inventory turnover 20%
- **AI/Automation:** Reduced manual overhead 35% through intelligent workflow automation using LLM APIs

## **Why I Want to Build at AWS**

I'm passionate about cloud infrastructure because it's the foundation that enables innovation at global scale. AWS doesn't just provide compute and storage—it democratizes access to cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, serverless computing, and GenAI through services like Bedrock. I want to be part of the team that builds these primitives and empowers customers to "Invent and Simplify" their own businesses.

Having been an AWS customer and beneficiary of the AWS Premier Partner program, I understand the customer perspective deeply. I know what it means when an API endpoint has 99.99% uptime versus 99.9%, when cold start times matter for serverless functions, or when managed services reduce undifferentiated heavy lifting. This customer empathy, combined with my technical skills and startup mentality, positions me to build services that truly delight customers.

## **What I Bring to AWS**

- **Full-Stack DevOps Expertise:** Python, SQL, AWS, CI/CD, infrastructure automation, monitoring/alerting
- **AI/ML Integration:** Hands-on experience with GenAI APIs (AWS Bedrock, Claude, OpenAI, Hunyuan T1, DeepSeek)
- **Scalability Mindset:** Proven ability to architect systems serving hundreds of thousands of users
- **Startup Agility:** Comfortable with ambiguity, rapid iteration, and wearing multiple hats
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Experience working directly with C-suite executives and cross-functional teams
- **Customer Obsession:** Data-driven approach to understanding and solving customer problems

## **Immediate Availability & Relocation**

I am completing my B.A. in Environmental Studies at UCSB (expected graduation April 2026) and am available for full-time roles starting Q2 2026. I am actively planning to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area or Seattle and am excited about the opportunity to work on-site with the AWS team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience scaling platforms, building automation infrastructure, and leveraging AWS services can contribute to AWS's mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. Thank you for considering my application.

I look forward to the opportunity to "Invent and Simplify" at AWS.

**Dive Deep,**

Tony V. Nguyen
